ToDo List
The project was written on React.js, contains store from Redux and scss preprocessor. 
Some other libraries that were used: react-redux, query-string, classnames, react-fa(font awesome icons), react-router-dom v4.22 react-router-redux v5-alfa, redux-undo, react-progressbar.

You have an infinite hierachy of categories and tasks in them. Tasks can be flagged completed and moved to another category. Also you can rename, delete categories or add nested. Progressbar considers satisfied categories in which all tasks are done or if it’s empty.
Undo/Redo works when you add task in list of tasks. 

Enter npm install and npm start to run app.
